# CodexApp 

CodexApp should use the Codex framework to be able to easily develop and generate pseudo-applications based on SuperCollider scripts and processes. 

## Design concepts

1. Each of the applications should be runnable just like any other
1. They should be able to support app icons
1. They should be easily re-developed using the CodexApp interfaces
1. They should simply execute all of their processes at runtime like any script (no compilation necessary)
1. Finally, they should ideally be clean, i.e. it should be easy to configure them such that no ugly terminal interfaces open if you don't want them to
